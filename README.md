# Modular ship attatchment system in unity

In our game, you can build spaceships like you're playing with building blocks in real-time. This idea was inspired by 'Captain Forever,' but we took it a step further by making it in 3D. Each part of the ship, which we call modules, was designed to easily connect with others, forming different shapes and functions. These modules can attach or detach from each other during gameplay. To build a ship you simply click to select a part, drag it over one of the orbs that show up, and then release.

Some problems that taking this idea to 3D created were figuring out where to 'float' a module when you're holding it and designing a control system that lets you manage flying your ship and building it at the same time.
